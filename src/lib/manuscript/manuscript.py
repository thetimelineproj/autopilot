class Manuscript():
    """
    This class holds all instructions for running a GUI application. The
    data can be merged from several data instruction files.
    All files given on the command line to Autopilot are concatenated into
    one Manuscript. A Manuscript can also have Include instructions that
    include other data instruction files.

    The program searches for the program to manuscripts in the following ways:
     1. As given on the command line
     2. In given paths (if any)
     3. In the directory %USER_HOME%/Autopilot
     4. In the directories given by AUTOPILOT_HOME environment variable

    If no script file is given as an option the default start script is
    Autopilot.data.txt.
